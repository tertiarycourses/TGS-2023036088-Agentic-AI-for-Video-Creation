# Lab 02 Prompt Hermes to Create a Simple Video

**Course:** Agentic AI for Video Creation (`TGS-2023036088`)  
**Version:** v3.0  
**Primary deliverable:** simple-video.mp4, shot-plan.json and ffprobe.json

## Objective

Use a copy-ready Hermes prompt to convert a supplied 15-second brief into a validated shot plan and deterministic preview video.

## Files

- `data/video-brief.json`
- `starter/render_preview.py`
- `verify.py`
- `solution/shot-plan-approved.json`
- `AI-PROMPTS.md` and `AI-PROMPTS.pdf` - identical copy-ready learner prompt resources.
- `evidence/checklist.md` and `evidence/checklist.pdf` - evidence gate.
- `verify.py` - deterministic acceptance verifier.

## Detailed procedure

1. Open project folder
2. Submit bounded prompt
3. Validate shot plan
4. Run preview renderer
5. Probe MP4
6. Record evidence

1. Open this lab folder as the current project in Hermes Desktop.
2. Read `AI-PROMPTS.md`; replace only the named placeholders with supplied synthetic values.
3. Ask Hermes to inspect the local files before it proposes a plan.
4. Require a preview before any network, paid-generation, upload or scheduling side effect.
5. Run `python3 verify.py` and retain the PASS output with the requested evidence.

## Acceptance check

The shot plan is valid JSON, totals 15 seconds, uses only supplied assets, and the generated MP4 passes dimensions, codec and duration checks.

## Troubleshooting

- If Hermes reports the wrong model, start a new session after selecting `MiniMax-M3`; an existing session may retain its original model.
- If a tool is missing, use the documented deterministic fallback and record the limitation instead of inventing a successful call.
- If a skill is not discovered, check its YAML frontmatter, directory name and `SKILL.md` filename, then restart skill discovery.
- If review or upload is blocked, inspect the exact dependency status and compare the approved payload hash with the current master hash.
- If a trial or quota differs from the course note, record the current live account terms and use the fallback path.

## Safety boundary

Use only supplied or authorized assets. Never paste a MiniMax key, OAuth token or YouTube credential into a prompt, lab file, screenshot or repository. YouTube examples default to `private`; public visibility requires an explicit trainer-supervised decision.
