# Lab 05 Create a Custom Branded Video Skill

**Course:** Agentic AI for Video Creation (`TGS-2023036088`)  
**Version:** v3.0  
**Primary deliverable:** custom-video.mp4, brand-review.json and render-evidence.json

## Objective

Turn brand, tone and style rules into a reusable Hermes skill, render a custom video and verify the output against brand and technical evidence.

## Files

- `data/brand-profile.yaml`
- `custom-skill/SKILL.md`
- `custom-skill/scripts/render_brand_video.py`
- `verify.py`
- `solution/custom-video.mp4`
- `AI-PROMPTS.md` and `AI-PROMPTS.pdf` - identical copy-ready learner prompt resources.
- `evidence/checklist.md` and `evidence/checklist.pdf` - evidence gate.
- `verify.py` - deterministic acceptance verifier.

## Detailed procedure

1. Approve brand profile
2. Create SKILL.md
3. Bind templates
4. Render video
5. Review frames
6. Version evidence

1. Open this lab folder as the current project in Hermes Desktop.
2. Read `AI-PROMPTS.md`; replace only the named placeholders with supplied synthetic values.
3. Ask Hermes to inspect the local files before it proposes a plan.
4. Require a preview before any network, paid-generation, upload or scheduling side effect.
5. Run `python3 verify.py` and retain the PASS output with the requested evidence.

## Acceptance check

The custom skill is discoverable, uses relative or Hermes template paths, creates an MP4, passes the technical probe and meets every required brand token.

## Troubleshooting

- If Hermes reports the wrong model, start a new session after selecting `MiniMax-M3`; an existing session may retain its original model.
- If a tool is missing, use the documented deterministic fallback and record the limitation instead of inventing a successful call.
- If a skill is not discovered, check its YAML frontmatter, directory name and `SKILL.md` filename, then restart skill discovery.
- If review or upload is blocked, inspect the exact dependency status and compare the approved payload hash with the current master hash.
- If a trial or quota differs from the course note, record the current live account terms and use the fallback path.

## Safety boundary

Use only supplied or authorized assets. Never paste a MiniMax key, OAuth token or YouTube credential into a prompt, lab file, screenshot or repository. YouTube examples default to `private`; public visibility requires an explicit trainer-supervised decision.
